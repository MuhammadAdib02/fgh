		<p>While most of us are familiar with pizzas, have you wondered how it was invented?<br><br>The history of pizza takes us back to the Neolithic age where food similar to pizza was eaten- flatbreads that were oven-baked and topped with various ingredients. However, it was not till the 1600’s when the first dish that is known as the pizza was created by bakers in Naples, Italy. It was sold as ‘poor people’s food’ to the Neapolitans at that time.</p>

		<p>However, in the 1800s, pizza’s reputation took a turn for the better when King Umberto I and Queen Margherita came to visit Italy. Legend has it that Queen Margherita grew bored of her constant diet of French food and had requested to try a variety of pizzas. A baker named Raffaele Esposito of Da Pietro Pizzeria (now known as Pizzeria Brandi) invented a pie with red tomato sauce, white mozzarella, and green basil which won the approval of the queen. It is known as the Margherita pizza today.</p>
		
		<p>Pizza then rose to global popularity in the late 1800s when Italians began migrating to America, bringing along their recipes and cuisines with them. Soon, pizzerias were blooming all over America, from New York to Chicago to New Jersey, each with its unique take. Thanks to this rich history, we’re able to enjoy a variety of pizzas in Malaysia now with American pizzas being a more popular choice.</p>
